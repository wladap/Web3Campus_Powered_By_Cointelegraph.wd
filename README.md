## Project Overview

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** Web3Campus powered by Cointelegraph 
- **Brief Description:** Web3Campus is an online educational platform for learning Web3 skills and professions. Our goal is to supply the Web3 market with professionals capable to build and grow projects through cutting-edge solutions.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Till Feb ‘23, we’re going to create educational materials fully dedicated to EOS: one core course, two mini-courses, and two engaging quests. With efficient learning methodology and Web3 mechanics, we will accelerate the adoption of the EOS ecosystem for Web2 developers. The result of our partnership will be 1K new builders and creators for EOS.  
- **Reason for Interest:** - We started to form the idea in Q1 2022. The idea is a logical sequel to my media background and my interest in supplying people with the best and most up-to-date knowledge about Web3. Our goal is to teach developers, product managers, and other specialists how Web3 works. To be able to proudly recommend our alumni to friends and partners because we are confident in the quality of our education. We put together all the required ‘pieces of the puzzle’ for a successful EdTech company that has the potential to become a unicorn.

- Vlad — CEO with strong technical background (as developer and CTO), who is responsible for the design and how it actually works after the development cycle.
- Me — vision, business development, and Web3 market expertise:
- Artem — CCO/CMO at one of the biggest EdTech holdings ($185 mln revenue in ‘21)
- Leo — CBDO  with passion, unlimited energy, and a large network.
- Cointelegraph — a strong and valuable strategic partner that provides brand, network, and quick go-to-market.

Demo of the platform: https://app.web3campus.com/courses/demo_lesson (Desktop only)

### Ecosystem Fit

- We’re going to solve the core mission of the ecosystem - to attract individual developers and whole dev teams for building innovative products on EOS.
- Our target audience is Web2 developers open for entering Web3 and non-tech users who are interested in NFT, P2E, and other entertaining Web3 mechanics
- We’re capable to solve the problem of difficult field immersion and fill the lack of professionals and teams with high-quality execution.
- No, there are no such solutions built on EOS. Overall, our competitors are Web2 educational projects. The fight is for the brightest minds. For example https://codecademy.com. Also, there are other Learn2Earn projects: e.g., Buildspace - https://buildspace.so - introduces users to ecosystem tools and rewards them with NFTs. 
We have a strong vision of how to build high-quality Web3 education and enhance it with working Web3 concepts - from decentralized identity to metaverse. Current competitors have just one of that… or none of that.
